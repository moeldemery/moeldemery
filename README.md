<h1 align="center">Hi, This is moeldemery 👋</h1>

AI Transformation & Intelligent Automation Consultant with 6+ years of enterprise experience across RPA, AI-enabled automation, and backend engineering.

My professional work over the past years was primarily developed and maintained within **company-managed Git repositories** (enterprise GitLab / Azure DevOps / GitHub Enterprise), which is why my personal GitHub activity was limited during that period.

I am currently **reviving and actively maintaining this GitHub profile** to share selected public projects, learning work, and technical experiments that reflect my expertise and ongoing development.
